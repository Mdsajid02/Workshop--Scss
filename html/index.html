                        <img src="cybage.png" height="100px" ;width="100px">
                        <p>Innovation is often associated with changing technology or the implementation of a new solution. In reality, innovation is merely doing things differently and more effectively than you have in the past. Innovation isn’t as complex as it may seem—you just have to be open to change.

Innovation may seem like more of a luxury than a necessity. According to a Sage study, more than one-third of small businesses globally say they’re too swamped to explore new ideas. However, in today’s constantly changing business environment, you can’t afford to only do what you’ve always done. You and your organization need to believe change is necessary in order to thrive. </p>
